# Instrument_Two
A performance-orientated accessible drum machine

Instrument Two was designed in collaboration with Tim Leathem and the Drake Music Project Northern Ireland. It is a programmable drum machine orientated toward live performance, and designed specially to address the access barriers Tim encounters in music-making. The instrument features four drum pads used to trigger one-shot drum sounds. Tim can use these drum pads to trigger single hits or more complex patterns.
